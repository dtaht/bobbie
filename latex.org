\begin{equation}
rate=data/interval
\end{equation}

Another way to look at this of course, is that:

\begin{equation}
interval * rate = data
\end{equation}

But the real transform we want is 

\begin{equation}
interval = data / rate
\end{equation}

And we want to rescale the inbound rate to the ideal rate:

creating a virtual clock that can run forward.


Now that we have a virtual clock running ahead of time with the
*same delay 

The virtual clock has got to increase monotonically, until at some point
the real clock "catches up".

that's not the only problem. 



We convert rate into time per byte, which, using a nanosecond clock.
